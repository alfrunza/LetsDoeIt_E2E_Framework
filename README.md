# LetsDoeIt_E2E_Framework

IMPORTANT!!!
Please note that the application tested in this framework contains adult content. Viewer discretion is advised.

This project was my first attempt at Test Automation. It is incomplete because shortly after starting it I realized that it's very hard to maintain such a structure.
As a result, I started researching the Page Object Model design pattern to make it easier to maintain on the long run.
The tests themselves are part of an E2E UI Automation Suite for the application.
